Python Simulation Code for generating the data and the figures in the article Dynamic resource allocation for controlling pathogen spread on a large animal metapopulation network (Cristancho-Fajardo L., Ezanno P., Vergu E.):

- The fixed_parameters folder contains the fixed simulation setting, fixed network structure and fixed demographic parameters. As well as the notebook on their generation. 

- The vaccination folder, contains:

  - The dynamic folder, contains:
    - The score_list folder: contains the text files with the names of the score functions to be tested. As well as the notebook on their generation. 
    - The vaccination_functions.py script gathers the main functions used in the generation of the simulated epidemic under vaccination allocation
    - vacc_endemicdynamic.py is the script that generates the simulated dynamics under vaccination according to a given scoring function with b_fix = 25\% of initial total population, in the endemic scenario.
    - vacc_epidemicdynamic.py is the script that generates the simulated dynamics under vaccination according to a given scoring function with b_fix = 25\% of initial total population, in the epidemic scenario.
    - *launcher_vacc_endemicdynamic.sh**: script shell that launches 50 runs of vacc_endemicdynamic.py for a given $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID (which indicates the scoring function according to the score_list folder).
